# Important Notes
This is a guide to set this bot manager up. The version is discord.js v13.4.0. It took me a ton of time and dedication. There might be bugs so make sure to fix them. This bot was made at the start of 2022 that's why its not the best!

Disclaimer: This project is 2 years old, it will be bugged and hard to set up.

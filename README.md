  * [nodejs](https://nodejs.org) version 16.6 or higher, I recommend the latest STABLE version
  * A VPS would be advised, so you don't need to keep your PC/laptop/RasPi 24/7 online!

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand</summary>

  **NOTE:** *You can do the exact same configuration inside of the `example.env` file, just make sure to rename it to `.env` or use environment variables!*

   1. Fill in all required data in `config.json ` **NOTE:** *If you're on replit.com, it is exposed to everyone!(use process.env instead)*
   2. You can adjust some settings in the other `.json` Files, **BUT PLEASE __KEEP__ MY CREDITS & ADS!** This is the only way on how my hard work is "revenued".
   3. Now start the bot by opening a cmd line in that folder and typing: `node .` or `node index.js`
